# WePrint Web
A Drexel Senior Design Project

## Abstract
WePrint allows customers to find makers to print their 3D models. The site has two sides: makers and customers. For customers WePrint provides fair prices for services by implementing a blind bidding system. Customers can post a job and receive bids from makers, who can see all the details of the job but not other makersâ€™ bids. This provides maximum value by finding customers fair prices and allowing makers to make effective use of their printers at prices they are comfortable with.
